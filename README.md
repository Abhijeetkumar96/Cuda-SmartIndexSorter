# Cuda-SmartIndexSorter
	Welcome to Cuda-SmartIndexSorter, an efficient CUDA-based library designed to sort indices based on corresponding key values without modifying the original key-value pairs. This repository provides high-performance solutions tailored for applications requiring optimized indexing based on key arrays, leveraging the power of NVIDIA's CUDA technology.

## Features
- High Performance: Utilizes CUDA's parallel processing capabilities to ensure high-speed sorting operations.
- Flexibility: Designed to work with any numeric key type that can be sorted using radix sort.
- Minimal Data Movement: Sorts indices rather than actual data, minimizing memory bandwidth usage.
- Easy Integration: Simple API for integration with existing CUDA projects or for new developments.
- Example Code: Includes samples demonstrating how to use the library in various scenarios.

## Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA Compute Capability 3.5 or higher
- CUDA Toolkit 10.0 or later
- C++ compiler compatible with the CUDA Toolkit

## Quick Start Guide
Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
